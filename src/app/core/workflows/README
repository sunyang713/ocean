maybe congregate all epics/sagas/synchronous workflows here?

maybe this belongs in 'actions' too? no need to separate into a different folder?

no I think having unitized actions vs higher-level ones is a good idea.



but maybe there can still be some 'unit' actions taht are asyncrhonous


nah so here are the 'side effects'. /reactive/ to an atomic action.


epics vs sagas. epics are push pattern (push from action --> do some stuff)
sagas are pull (pull the action I want --> do some stuff). sagas aren't quite as semantic for most stuff because you're simulating a 'listen' activity using pull. put perhaps can still be useful for different kinds of side-effects. side-effects from actions you actively want to pull?

no thunks, or maybe? thunks break the pattern of components only dispatching plain actions. or anyone trying to interact with the store with only plain actions.

promises kind of get away with it because the promise will _eventually resolve_ to a plain action. so it's not the actor's fault exactly.


need better name for this folder. or maybe actually use epics, sagas, thunks in separate folders.
