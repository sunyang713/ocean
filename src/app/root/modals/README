the point of a modal is that it covers up ALL of the UI, it forces attention and removes user control. it blatantly ignores any hierarchy, and THUS are difficult to use correctly from a UX perspective. however, sometimes they have to be used and that's fine.

As such, they should be /treated/ carefully as well. they behave like gods, so they have to be put in a folder that reflects their global nature.

This folder holds the different 'modals' that can be displayed. Other /containers/ (usually) would probably import these modals to display based on some handler function. the components would not know what modals are or want to show them for any reason.



still unsure if this is a 'root' thing or a 'components' thing.
