maybe this folder is still necessary for universally reusable componetns that cna't be put into 'ui' library, (b/c project specific, depends on certain dependency/tech choices.)


resuable components that are _project-specific_, have dependencies.





if reusable, go in here. otherewise, get out.
no hook ups with anything else, no import ../../../.. no redux state. if redux state is needed for a child comopnent, /prop drill/ that shit. because that means the parent component needed to know about that state idea.
