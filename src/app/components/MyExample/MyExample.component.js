import React from 'react'
// import './styles' // maybe? maybe not. CSS isn't designed for tiny, componentized features,
// so maybe inlined styles or styled-components is philosophically better. that way we 
// have two distinct ways of styling. global CSS, or scoped modules via JS.
// scoped styles here? or should I do styled-componetns?

export default function MyExample() {
