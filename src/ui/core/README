maybe a different name. 'principles,' 'aesthetic,' 'foundation,'



the point of this folder is to house the /principles/ of my ui. completely implementation/tech agnostic (as much as possible)


should just be some 'configuraiton/variables' of colours, font choices, typography, spacing,

all the 'numbers' and 'values.'


then the 'implementations' will use this package to build their files.



use ini or yaml?
