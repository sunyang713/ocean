this 'libary/package' first and foremost is a package of /principles/, patterns, designs, guidelines. then comes the implementation (css, stylus, react comps, etc...)







so this might be the 'library' package of reusable components. possibly useable in a completely different website, so that's why it's at the very top, completely on its own.

though this will probaby rely on styles too. mabye they'll get put together...? intersering.

need a good name. probably an element. carbon-ui, silicon-ui, cesium-ui, style-ui, ocean-ui,

black-ui

white-ui





possblye use rollup




will styles & components be seaparate npm (package.json) packages?




components/react
componets/vue
components/......????????

all component variations depend on styles....


import { thing } from 'ui/react'
import 'ocean-ui/css'
import 'ocean-ui/stylus'


@import 'ui/stylus'


and then the scss version...







should there be components/ styles/ 'abstract' folder at the bottom? framework stuff vs componentized stuff?
