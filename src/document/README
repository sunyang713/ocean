I want to isolate and focus the build of the 'HTML document' because there are some cool non-trivial things you can do.

This is usually handled by html-webpack-plugin + like 80 plugins to the plugin. that's the easy way, not pretty, not
elegant.

We basically want to abstract the website from the application software and the housing/containing document. Application
can be slapped into any compliant document, document can handle any application given it's detailed parameters.

basically gonna be one super function. hopefully simple, but we'll see.


need a /templating engine/ This is basically it's own project.

react + jsx empahsis is on the javascript and all that fancy stuff, so not necessary here. Same with Vue. Can't stick
with just pure html because we need some interpolation. so probably something like ejs or pug. ejs seems the best for
now.


don't forget to minify etc


weird part of injecting webpack manifest & runtime, b/c I don't think the document should actually be aware of that,
only the builder for the document.



.....and as always... how the fuck do you handle public path...?
