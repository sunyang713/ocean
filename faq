Lots of design choices. you will disagree with most of them, but you're wrong.


typescript
no


semicolons
no


default vs named exports
in folders, array as default, then named for individual exports. ????


javascript fatigue
stop crying


leading commas
tryna be different


folder purpose/exports. only export collection through index, otherwise, if folder is not a 'collection,' but rather a 'package,' then... up to caller/implementor to 'assemble' parts?


redux
/concepts/

react
first of all, react engine, schedular, etc are pretty state of the art. alternatives don't compete.
second, the /concepts/ are pretty good too. a 'component' is just function. honestly, what you write is library agnostic if you write well.



jsx vs hyperscript vs some other markup language?
tryan be different. html syntax is antiquated?
