less interfacing, layers of abstraction, indirection.

more /simplicity/, but /philosophy/.


reduce human error with /design/, not implementation/safety nets.

altering implementation to 'fix' human error (typos) is bullshit. name shit accurately. linters and good programmers fix human errors. not extra implementation/overcomplicated design.



an Advanced (bloated) boilerplate with XXX dependencies (compare with other top boilerplates)

built on /principles/, /philosophies/, and /concepts/ instead of \tech\.

documented to shit with reasoning behind design choices, app structure/architecutre, naming conventions, etc.

javascript-fatigue ignorant/agnostic.

monorepo, packages within this package. utils (for all utilities), styles for my /framework/ of styles.



difference/balance between bloat and what is required at the enterprise-level.



"Some assembly required" pattern.
SAR




convention for undersatnding, not for magic implementation.
